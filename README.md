# cop4720-project2
Contribution to a group project of a simple PHP site to utilize database interaction.


Project #2

Requirements:
•	Groups of 3 or 4, email me teams by next Monday (Nov. 6)
•	Refine the data model developed in Project #1 as a group
•	Create a script that will insert data into the tables (use IMDB or some online data source to get access to a repository of film data). Insert enough data to support non-trivial queries (i.e. films from different producers, genres, certifications and actors).
•	Each individual in each team is responsible for creating 2 stored procedures that execute parameterized queries against the data model.
o	Must use stored procedures
o	Can not use object relational mapper (no Hibernate or Linq2Sql)
o	UI needs to accept input from user and pass the data down as parameters to the stored procedure, execute the stored procedure and return the result to the interface.
•	Any technology is fine (java, .net, python, etc …)
•	Windows or Web client is fine
